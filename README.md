## Description

The Corpse Candle (Welsh: *Canwyll Corff* or *Cannwyll Corph*) is a Welsh death omen consisting of mysterious pale blue, white, or ghostly lights seen flickering along paths, over fields, or near churches. According to Welsh folklore, these supernatural flames predict an imminent death in the community, with the light's path often tracing the route a funeral procession will soon follow.

This atmospheric phenomenon is deeply embedded in Welsh culture and shares similarities with will-o'-the-wisps and other ghost lights, but is distinguished by its specific association with death prediction and its cultural context in Wales and Welsh border regions.
